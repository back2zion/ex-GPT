### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration (development, staging, production)
- Secure credential management using environment variables
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Logging configuration for different environments
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

## API Design Standards

### RESTful Endpoints
- Consistent URL structure following REST principles
- Standardized HTTP status code usage
- JSON-based request/response formatting
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling and messaging

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for stateless operations
- Role-based access control integration
- Session management for web interface
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Permission validation middleware

### Request Processing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Request rate limiting and throttling
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Response compression and optimization

## AI Integration Patterns

### LLM Service Integration
- Modular LLM service abstraction layer
- Connection pooling for model inference
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### RAG Implementation
- Vector database integration patterns
- Document embedding and retrieval workflows
- Context window management and optimization
- Relevance scoring and ranking algorithms
- Real-time document indexing capabilities

### Streaming Responses
- Server-sent events (SSE) for real-time chat
- WebSocket integration for bidirectional communication
- Chunked response processing
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Connection management and recovery

## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Blueprint-based route organization
- Service layer abstraction for business logic
- Dependency injection for testing and flexibility
- Factory pattern for application creation
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization and indexing
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory)
- Lazy loading for expensive operations
- Background task processing (Celery)
- Resource pooling and connection management

### Security Implementation
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection and CSRF tokens
- Secure headers and HTTPS enforcement
- File upload security and validation
- Audit logging for security events

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all modules
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Parameterized tests for edge cases
- Test fixtures for consistent data setup
- Continuous integration testing

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing with real databases
- Service integration validation
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security vulnerability testing

### Deployment Configuration
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Blue-green deployment strategies

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging Implementation
- Structured logging with JSON formatting
- Log level configuration for different environments
- Request/response logging for API calls
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection

### Debugging Tools
- Flask debug toolbar for development
- Profiling tools for performance analysis
- Memory usage monitoring
- Database query analysis
- Custom debugging endpoints for diagnostics
